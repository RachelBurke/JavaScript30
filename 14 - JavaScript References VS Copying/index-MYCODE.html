      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.splice(); //Splice will take a copy of the original array if you do not give input

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person; // This is a reference
      captain.number = 99;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 }); //Empty object, object to copy, change a property
      console.log(cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person }; //In react

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
